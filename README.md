AWS Project - Serverless Web Application

### Description
In this end-to-end web application we are using **CodeCommit**, **Amplify**, **Cognito**, **Lambda**, **IAM**, **API Gateway**, and **DynamoDB**.

The workflow typically operates as follows: **CodeCommit** acts as the Git-based source control to manage code. 

**Amplify** is used for hosting and deploying the front-end, while integrating with **Cognito** for user authentication and authorization. 

**Lambda** provides serverless backend logic, triggered by requests via **API Gateway**, which routes these requests securely. 

**IAM** controls access and permissions for users and services, ensuring secure interactions. 

Finally, **DynamoDB** serves as the NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data. This serverless approach creates a secure, scalable, and automated web application pipeline.
